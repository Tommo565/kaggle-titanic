# kaggle-titanic
My code for the Kaggle Titanic competition

Scored 83.72% on the training set and 80.38% with the final submission on the test set.

To-do: 
* Clustering + removing outliers (e.g. huge groups / families)
* A deeper look into the family, ticket & cabin variables. The group someone was in looks to be a good predictor of survival.
* Can we split groups by familial and non-familial groups using the ticket variable and family variables?
* Can we infer familial role from the family variable? Could we identify the children and their rough ages based upon the age of the parents?
* Make this an actually relevent README file!
